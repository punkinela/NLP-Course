Akamai Firewall for AI is a purpose-built security solution designed to protect AI-powered applications, large language models (LLMs), and AI-driven APIs from emerging cyberthreats. By securing inbound AI queries and outbound AI responses,  the firewall closes security gaps that generative AI introduces. With real-time detection, policy-based enforcement, and  adaptive security measures, this firewall protects against  prompt injections, sensitive data leaks, adversarial exploits,  and AI-specific denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Seamlessly integrating with edge, cloud, hybrid, and  on-prem environments, Firewall for AI ensures consistent security, safety, governance, and compliance while  preserving performance. AI-specific threat protection Firewall for AI provides comprehensive security for AI-driven applications by identifying and mitigating AI-specific vulnerabilities that traditional security tools fail to address. • Prompt injection defense — protects against attackers manipulating AI models  through deceptive inputs. • Data loss prevention (DLP) — detects and blocks sensitive data leaks in  AI-generated responses, and protects against receiving sensitive data  in the requests. • Toxic and harmful content filtering — flags hate speech, misinformation,  and offensive content before delivery. • Adversarial AI security — protects against remote code execution, model  backdoors, and data poisoning attacks. • Denial-of-service mitigation — mitigates AI-driven DoS attacks by controlling  excessive query usage and model overload
